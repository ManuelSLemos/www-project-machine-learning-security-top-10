Description:

Output integrity attacks occur when an attacker manipulates the model\'s
output to cause it to behave in an undesirable way.

Example Attack Scenario:

For instance, an attacker could alter the model\'s output during
prediction time to cause it to produce incorrect results.

How to Prevent:

To prevent output integrity attacks, it is important to secure the
prediction process and to validate the model\'s output.
