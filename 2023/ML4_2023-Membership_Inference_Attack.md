Description:

Membership interference attacks occur when an attacker manipulates the
model\'s training data in order to cause it to behave in a way that
exposes sensitive information.

Example Attack Scenario:

For example, an attacker could manipulate the training data to cause the
model to produce different predictions for individuals who belong to
different groups.

How to Prevent:

To prevent membership interference attacks, it is important to use
secure training algorithms and to monitor the model\'s behavior during
training.
