Description:

Corrupted packages attacks occur when an attacker modifies or replaces a
machine learning library or model that is used by a system.

Example Attack Scenario:

For example, an attacker could replace a machine learning library with a
corrupted version that causes the system to behave in an undesirable
way.

How to Prevent:

To prevent corrupted packages attacks, it is important to use secure and
trustworthy sources for machine learning libraries and models, and to
verify their integrity before using them.
