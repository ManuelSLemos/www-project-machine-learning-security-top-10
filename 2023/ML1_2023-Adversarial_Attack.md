Description:\
Adversarial attacks are a type of attack in which an attacker
deliberately alters input data to mislead the model.

Example Attack Scenario:

For example, an attacker could add small perturbations to an image to
cause the model to misclassify it.

How to Prevent:

Defending against adversarial attacks can be challenging, but techniques
such as adversarial training and using robust models can be effective
