Description:

Model stealing attacks occur when an attacker gains access to the
model\'s parameters.

Example Attack Scenario:

For instance, an attacker could steal the model by downloading it from a
cloud-based service or by extracting it from an application.

How to Prevent:

To prevent model stealing attacks, it is important to secure the model
and its parameters, for example, by using encryption and access
controls.
