Description:

Neural net reprogramming attacks occur when an attacker manipulates the
model\'s parameters to cause it to behave in an undesirable way.

Example Attack Scenario:

For example, an attacker could modify the model\'s parameters to cause
it to produce incorrect predictions.

How to Prevent:

To prevent neural net reprogramming attacks, it is important to secure
the model and its parameters, and to monitor the model\'s behavior
during prediction time.
