Welcome to the repository for the OWASP Machine Learning Security Top 10
project!

## Overview

The primary aim of the OWASP Machine Learning Security Top 10 project is to
deliver an overview of the top 10 security issues of machine learning systems.
More information on the project scope and target audience is available in our
[project working group charter](https://owasp.org/www-project-machine-learning-security-top-10#div-charter)
